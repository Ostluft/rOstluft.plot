\title{Summarise y values over binned wind data.}
\usage{
stat_bin_wind(data, ws, wd, z, groups = NULL, fun = "mean",
  fun.args = list(), nmin = 3, ws_max = NA,
  wd_cutfun = function(wd) wd_classes(wd, wd_binwidth = 45),
  wd_offset = 0, ws_cutfun = function(ws) ws_classes(ws, ws_binwidth =
  1))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.frame or tibble containing the data (wide format)}

\item{ws}{string giving the wind velocity parameter name (wind velocity preferably in m/s)}

\item{wd}{string giving the wind direction parameter name  in degrees}

\item{z}{string giving the parameter name to be summarised}

\item{groups}{can be NULL, wd, ws, ...}

\item{fun}{function or list of functions for summary.}

\item{fun.args}{A list of extra arguments to pass to fun.}

\item{nmin}{Minimum number of values for fun, if n < nmin: NA is returned}

\item{ws_max}{Maximum wind velocity for binning: above ws_max, z is set NA; can be NA}

\item{wd_offset}{offset for wind_direction (in degree) if groups = wd; bins are then calculated over (wd + wd_offset) %% 360}

\item{wd_binwidth}{width of bins (in degree) if groups = wd}

\item{ws_binwidth}{width of bins for wind velocity if groups = ws}
}
\value{
a tibble with summarised data

Computed variables
\itemize{
\item If groups = NULL: groups = "wd". In this case, bins are calculated over wind direction;
a tibble including wd and summarised z is returned
\item groups can be strings for other variables in data; then fun is applied over those;
a tibble including groups and summarised z is returned
}
}
\description{
Input data should be original unbinned data.
1-dimensional binning and calculating summary statistics over wind direction and/or wind velocity bins, respectively.
